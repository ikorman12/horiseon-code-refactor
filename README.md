# Horiseon code refactor

## Description
    This porject was meant to incoporate a search and correct method to viewing code, where we went into a code which was 100% operable and made it both more accessible and easier to read. This taqsk was challenging due to the fact there were no semantic eleemnts in the HTML so it was diddicult to find a place to begin whilst chnaging the css which was deeply embedded within the HTML. Some future changes to come would have to be adding a method of adjusting the websites screen to all screens not just full screen.
